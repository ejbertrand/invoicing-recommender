# invoicing-recommender

This is a Full-Stack Python developed web application made on Flask. 

It is built on top of Python (Flask + Jinja), using Javascript as API and HTML/CSS (Bootstrap) code.

The purpose is to build aa basic system for registering transactions and generating an invoice for them, printable in PDF and physical printers as well.
We can register different payment types, products and sub-categories (using Adjacency-Lists on a SQL database which was not included here for security reasons), creating transactions and view the history of made transactions.

The project is still under development and is expected to include:
- Invoice generation and printing on PDF format and physical printers as well.
- Recommender module (based on Machine Learning algorithms)
- Authentication/authorization of modules based on role

In the future, several robustness and security tests are going to be executed, as well as refactoring of the code. In the meantine, the important thing is to have an MPV :).
